# JavaScript Notes

- You can learn the **basic commands** of JavaScript in **1 to 2 weeks**.
- To **really master it**, it might take **1 to 1.5 years** of practice.
- First, **learn as much as you can**, then **build projects** to get better.

---

## Getting Started

- **Make a folder** for your project and **open it in VS Code** (you can just drag and drop it).
- **Install Node.js** â€“ it's a tool that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser.

## How JavaScript Works

- JavaScript is **synchronous by default**, which means it runs one task at a time and waits for each to finish before moving to the next.

## ðŸ”¹ Advantages of JavaScript
- Easy to use and learn
- Cross-platform compatibility (runs on all major browsers and OS)
- Large community support
- Powerful capabilities (DOM manipulation, API calls, etc.)
- Growing demand in industry
- Bright future with modern frameworks (React, Angular, etc.)

## ðŸ”¹ History of JavaScript
- **1995**: Developed by **Brendan Eich** for the **Netscape Navigator** browser.
- Initially called **Mocha**, later renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.
- Standardized as **ECMAScript** to ensure consistency across browsers.
- Introduced to allow interaction with webpages and dynamic content.
- With the help of **jQuery**, developers could manipulate only parts of a webpage without reloading the whole page.

## ðŸ”¹ ECMAScript (ES)
- ECMAScript is the official standard that JavaScript follows.
- It defines the languageâ€™s core features and syntax.
- Modern JavaScript is mostly based on **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** and later versions.
- Key ES6 features include:
  - Let and const
  - Arrow functions
  - Classes
  - Destructuring
  - Default parameters

## ðŸ”¹ JavaScript Expressions and Best Practices
- Use clear and meaningful variable/function names.
- Avoid global variables.
- Keep functions short and do one thing.
- Prefer **const** and **let** over **var**.
- Use strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`).
- Handle errors using try-catch blocks and Promises properly.

## ðŸ”¹ Objects and Functions in JavaScript
- Everything in JS is an object or can be treated like one.
- Functions can be:
  - Declared using function keyword
  - Anonymous
  - Arrow functions (`()=>{}`)
- Functions can be passed as arguments (higher-order functions).

## ðŸ”¹ JSX
- JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**.
- Created by **Facebook** for **React**.
- Allows HTML to be written inside JavaScript files.
- Helps in designing UI components easily in React.
