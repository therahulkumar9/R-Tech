# Types of Operators in JavaScript

## 1. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description         | Example            |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| =        | Assign              | x = 10             |
| +=       | Add and assign      | x += 5 (x = x + 5) |
| -=       | Subtract and assign | x -= 3             |
| \*=      | Multiply and assign | x \*= 2            |
| /=       | Divide and assign   | x /= 4             |
| %=       | Modulo and assign   | x %= 2             |

## 2. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description    | Example     |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| +        | Addition       | 5 + 2 = 7   |
| -        | Subtraction    | 5 - 2 = 3   |
| \*       | Multiplication | 5 \* 2 = 10 |
| /        | Division       | 10 / 2 = 5  |
| %        | Modulus        | 10 % 3 = 1  |
| ++       | Increment      | x++         |
| --       | Decrement      | x--         |

## 3. Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description           | Example |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| ==       | Equal to              | x == y  |
| ===      | Strict equal          | x === y |
| !=       | Not equal             | x != y  |
| !==      | Strict not equal      | x !== y |
| >        | Greater than          | x > y   |
| <        | Less than             | x < y   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less than or equal    | x <= y  |

## 4. Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Description | Example           |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| &&       | Logical AND | x > 5 && x < 10   |
| \|\|     | Logical OR  | x < 5 \|\| x > 10 |
| !        | Logical NOT | !(x == y)         |
